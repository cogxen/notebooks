This project focuses on analyzing the FIFA World Cup Tournament. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the FIFA World Cup matches.

Our goal is to analyze the dataset and answer the following questions:
1. Do teams perform better when playing as the host team in the men's FIFA World Cup?
2. Who were the top goal scorers, individually and by team?
3. Are the teams who perform better in the first (1st) or second (2nd) half of the match more likely to win the match?
